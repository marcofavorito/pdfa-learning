# History

## 0.1.0 (2021-01-02)

First release of the package.

- Data structures to represent a
  Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automaton (PDFA),
  and other utilities like rendering in Graphviz format.
- Implementation of the
  algorithm in [(Palmer & Goldberg, 2005)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397507005476).
- Implementation of the algorithm
  in [(Balle et al., 2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397512009309).
- First version of the documentation, with code examples.

Note: the implementation of (Balle et al., 2013)
is more stable and efficient of the one of
(Palmer & Goldberg, 2005).
Hence, the former one
should be what you are looking for,
in the vast majority of cases.
